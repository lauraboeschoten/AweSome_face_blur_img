# AweSome_face_blur_img

The goal of this script is to anonymize .img files in Instagram data-download packages. 
Make sure to save a copy of your data-download package as this code overwrites existing files. 

You can run the code in 'Main.py'. Make sure that all directories are set correct. 
This code 
1. detects all .img files in an instagram data-download package 
2. detects all faces on the .img files
3. stores a .csv file containing the emotional expressions of all faces on the .img files
4. blurs the faces on the .img files and overwrites them.
